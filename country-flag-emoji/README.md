Library to insert country flag emojis

## Content

Simple library containg a keyed object for each country and it's emoji.

## Modules & Node support

The package follows a hybrid module structure, supporting ES6 & CommonJS Module imports.
Node support can be implemented by changing the internal, relative import statements to include the file type suffix `.js` (not `.ts`!). This however breaks the CommonJS Module imports (`require()`), which should not be an issue if Node 12+ is used in the project.
